  Technology Choice: HTML (Like Mizuho)

  I recommend HTML with Chart.js (same as Mizuho project) because:

  ‚úÖ Immediate deployment - no build process needed
  ‚úÖ Professional presentation - enterprise-grade visuals
  ‚úÖ Interactive demos - live API calls and QR codes
  ‚úÖ Consistent branding - same design language as Mizuho
  ‚úÖ Analytics tracking - Google Analytics integration
  ‚úÖ Password protection - secure executive access
